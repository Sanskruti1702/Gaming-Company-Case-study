This project analyzes user behavior for ABC, a real-money online gaming platform, with the goal of evaluating player engagement and fairly distributing loyalty rewards. Using Python and pandas, I processed gameplay, deposit, and withdrawal data to calculate loyalty points for each user based on a weighted formula.
