### I have worked on several case studies utilizing Python for data analysis, with a focus on real-world datasets and business-relevant questions. These are few of them-
## 1. Gaming Company Analysis for Loyalty Points
#### Summary â€“ This project analyzes user behavior for ABC, a real-money online gaming platform, with the goal of evaluating player engagement and fairly distributing loyalty rewards. Using Python and pandas, I processed gameplay, deposit, and withdrawal data to calculate loyalty points for each user based on a weighted formula.

## 2. Airlines Data Analysis
#### Summary - In this project, I worked with an airline dataset to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The objective was to uncover insights related to airline performance, customer preferences, and operational metrics.
